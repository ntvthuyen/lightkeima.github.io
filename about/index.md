## About me!

My name is Vinh-Thuyen. 

You can pronounce my name by saying "thu" and "yen" as fast as possible. Thuyen has a lot of meaning in Chinese (about 19 Chinese characters for my name), there are both negative and possitive meaning but I love them all. But my mom wanted to name me following a person named Han Thuyen (韓詮), so 詮 is the primary meaning I believe. 

I'm a bachelor of computer science. 

I'm currently a Research assistant at MEILab - City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and trying my best to get my PhD admission at CityU. 

My main research interest is Human-computer Interaction, Information and Knowledge Management. I have various knowledge in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other computer-related-stuff.

I love HNMC, computers, linux, coding, learning, games, DoTA, dota 2, counter-strike, manga, guitar, math rock, running, swimming and penguins.
